                    Date: December 16, 2024, 9:30 AM<br>
                    Interviewed by: Detective Sarah Morrison

            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: What time did you arrive at the museum on December 15th?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: I came in around 9:00 AM as usual. It was a normal workday until Dr. Sterling called me into her office around 3 PM.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: What did she want to discuss?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: She seemed upset. She accused me of questioning her authentication of the Midnight Diamond. I had mentioned to a colleague that I thought we should get a second opinion, but it was just professional caution. She took it as an attack on her expertise.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: Then what happened?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: She asked me to stay late. Said we needed to talk more about it. I got an email at 7:15 PM confirming the meeting at 8:30. When I went to her office at 8:30, her door was closed and locked. I knocked several times but got no answer. I assumed she changed her mind and went home.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: What time did you leave the museum?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: I stayed in my office working on exhibition catalogs until about 9:30 PM, then I left. Look, I know the parking records show my car leaving later, but I can explain that. I forgot my phone in my office and had to come back around 10:45 PM. I was only inside for about 15 minutes.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: Did you see anyone else during your second visit?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: No, the place was quiet. I thought I heard voices from the direction of Gallery Wing 3, but the building echoes a lot at night. Could have been the security guard's radio.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: Do you have any reason to believe Dr. Sterling was planning to steal the diamond?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: No! She loved that museum. But... she had been stressed lately. Money troubles, I think. And she kept getting these calls that would make her upset. I don't want to speak ill of her, but something was definitely wrong.</div>

                    Date: December 16, 2024, 2:15 PM<br>
                    Interviewed by: Detective Sarah Morrison

            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: Walk me through your shift on December 15th.</div>
                <div class="answer">A: I started at 7:45 PM. Standard procedure—I check all the doors, make sure the alarm system is armed properly, then do rounds every hour. Everything was normal that night.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: Did you see Dr. Sterling?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: On the cameras, yes. I saw her enter her office around 8:47 PM. She looked agitated, kept looking over her shoulder. I made a note of it in my log because it seemed unusual.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: What about other staff members?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: I saw Marcus Chen leave around 9:30, then that art dealer Wellington left around 10:45. I didn't know Wellington was in the building—there was no visitor sign-in. That worried me, so I did an extra round of Gallery Wing 3 at 11:00 PM.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: And what did you find?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: The Midnight Diamond display case was closed and locked, everything looked fine. But when the alarm went off at 11:23, I ran back and the diamond was gone. The case was wide open.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: How is that possible if you just checked it 23 minutes earlier?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: I don't know! Only Dr. Sterling and I had keys to that case. My key was on me the whole time. She must have come back after I did my round.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: We need to ask about your financial situation.</div>
                <div class="answer">A: I know how it looks. Yes, I have debts. Yes, I asked Dr. Sterling for help. But I would never steal from this museum. It's been my life for 15 years. I'm telling you, check the cameras again. Someone else was there after my 11:00 round.</div>

                    Date: December 17, 2024, 10:00 AM<br>
                    Interviewed by: Detective Sarah Morrison
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: Why were you at the museum on December 15th?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: I had a 7:00 PM appointment with Dr. Sterling. We were discussing a potential acquisition for the museum—a 17th-century Persian manuscript. It's what I do for a living, Detective.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: But you've made multiple offers to buy the Midnight Diamond.</div>
                <div class="answer">A: On behalf of a client, yes. That's different from theft. My client is a legitimate collector who's willing to pay far above market value. Dr. Sterling refused every offer, which is her right.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: What time did your meeting end?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: Around 8:30 PM. The meeting was brief—she wasn't interested in the manuscript. She seemed distracted, kept checking her phone. When I mentioned the diamond one more time, she got angry and asked me to leave.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: Why didn't you sign out at the visitor log?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: Dr. Sterling met me at a side entrance. Said it would be more convenient. I thought it was odd, but I didn't question it.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: Security cameras show your car leaving at 10:45 PM. Where were you for those two hours?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: I was at a nearby coffee shop working on my laptop. I have a receipt. After our unpleasant meeting, I needed to clear my head before the drive home.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: Did you see anything unusual before you left?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: Actually, yes. When I was walking to my car around 8:40 PM, I saw someone—a woman—walking quickly toward the back of the museum. She was wearing a hood, so I couldn't see her face clearly. At the time, I assumed it was another staff member.</div>

                <div class="question">Q: What were you doing on December 15th?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: Normal evening shift. I clean the administrative offices and public areas after the museum closes. Start at 6:30, usually done by 10:00 PM.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: You reported hearing raised voices. Tell me about that.</div>
                <div class="answer">A: Yeah, around 8:30 PM. I was cleaning the hallway outside Dr. Sterling's office. I heard her arguing with someone—sounded like a man. They were shouting about "the plan" and "too risky." I couldn't make out everything, but Dr. Sterling said something like "I won't be a part of this anymore."</div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: Did you see who was with her?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: No, her door was closed. But about five minutes later, a man came out—that art dealer, Wellington. He looked angry, face all red. He practically ran past me without saying a word.</div>

            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: What did Dr. Sterling do after that?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: She came out maybe 15 minutes later, around 8:47. She looked upset, like she'd been crying. She went toward the gallery wing. I finished my work and left around 9:15 PM.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="qa-block">
                <div class="question">Q: Did you see anyone else that evening?</div>
                <div class="answer">A: Marcus Chen was still in his office when I left. And I saw that board member, Dr. Moore, leaving through the back exit around 8:00 PM. Thought that was strange since board members usually use the front entrance.</div>
